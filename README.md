# Unhandled Promise Rejection in React Native

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: unhandled promise rejections that can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.  Specifically, the application fails to handle errors gracefully when fetching data from an API.

## Bug Description
The `MyComponent` component attempts to fetch data from an API. However, it doesn't properly handle potential errors during the fetch process, such as network issues or API errors.  If the API request fails, the component crashes because of an unhandled promise rejection.

## Solution
The solution improves error handling by using a `try...catch` block within the asynchronous function and implementing fallback mechanisms.
